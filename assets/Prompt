Ah, I see! You want a **complete numbered sheet starting from your very first question this morning**, which was on JVM, not just strings. I can compile **all your questions from JVM, memory, type casting, and strings**, in chronological order, into one master list.

Here’s the **numbered question sheet starting from JVM topics**:

If you want, I can now **format this into a clean “question-only sheet PDF or Excel”** with numbers and sections for **easy printing or revision**.

Do you want me to do that next?
